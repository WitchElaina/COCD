# USTB Computer Organization Course Design

`2-6`

## Usage

You have to install `git` on your device.

Use `git checkout [branch_name]` to get the code you need in CG.

For example, to get homework 2-1 RegFile, type following commands

```git
git checkout 2-1
```

Then compress all files in the current dictory and upload it to CG.

## PS

`ADDIU`与`ADDU`无需进行访存操作, 所以其只需要将模块输入直接输出到对应端口即可.
